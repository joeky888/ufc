### üí° Features

* Single binary with almost zero setup
* Command output highlighting via `ufc <subcommand> <args>`
* Shell completion generating via `ufc completion` (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Powershell, Elvish)
* Command alias generating via `ufc alias` or `ufc ualias` (Bash, Zsh, Fish)
* Built-in time mode via `ufc --time <subcommand>` (like the [time command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Unix))) - Timing statistics when the subprogram exits
* Built-in watch mode via `ufc --watch 3s <subcommand>` (like the [watch command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_(command))) - Duration of waiting for executing subcommand periodically. Values can be `1.5h`, `2m`, `5s` or `1h2m5s`
* Written in safe rust and `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is used (Some dependencies are using `unsafe block` though)

#### ü§î *In a nutshell, ufc = [ugc](https://github.com/garabik/grc) + [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(Unix)) + [watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_(command)) + shell completion + cross platform.*

### üíª Platform support

* Support Linux (macOS, FreeBSD and Android Termux should also work)
* Support Cygwin/Msys2 and git-bash for Windows (CMD and Powershell are supported if the subcommand exists)

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Benchmark

* Up to 7.5x faster than [grc](https://github.com/garabik/grc) (compiled with `cargo build --release`, thanks to [buffered printer](https://github.com/BurntSushi/termcolor))
  * Bechmarks on Linux with CPU Intel i5-8250U (4C8T) 3.400GHz, same regex with [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal

### üçí Shell completion (Optional)

#### Bash: add this line to `~/.bashrc`

```sh
source <(ufc completion bash)
```

#### Zsh: add this line to `~/.zshrc`

```sh
source <(ufc completion zsh)
```

#### Fish: add this line to `config.fish`

```sh
eval (ufc completion fish)
```

#### PowerShell: add this line to `profile.ps1`

```sh
ufc completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

### üèÜ Milestones

This porject is still at an early stage of development.

* Version 1.0.0 should support 10 subcommands
* Version 2.0.0 should support 20 subcommands
* Version 3.0.0 should support 30 subcommands

Currently supported commands are

* df
* docker (incomplete)
* dig
* du
* env
* fdisk
* free
* id
* ifconfig
* journalctl
* ping
* top

### üìî TODO

* Github badges
* Add more [ValueHints](https://docs.rs/clap/3.0.0-beta.2/clap/enum.ValueHint.html) for better shell completion generating
* Add Crontab mode and Daemon mode (like the [crontab command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)) - Runs the subprogram as a scheduling daemon
* Colorize from stdout E.g. `cat /path/to/file.log | ufc`
* A benchmark script
* Use async rust and show statistics of cpu and memory usage
